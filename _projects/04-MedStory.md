    <p><strong>MedStory</strong> is a mobile platform created to help patients with chronic illnesses document their daily symptoms and metrics. Built by a team of student developers and now an LLC, MedStory supports condition management for users navigating heart disease, long-term recovery, and more.</p>

    <p>I contributed to the development of core features as part of a collaborative team of experienced developers. My work focused on the <strong>calendar logging interface</strong> and the <strong>data export function</strong> for generating PDFs from user input.</p>

    <p>On the frontend, I integrated a calendar library using <strong>React Native and Expo</strong> to enable users to view and edit entries by date. On the backend, I developed <strong>Django-based Python functions</strong> that pulled user data and formatted it into stylized PDFs using HTML and CSS.</p>

    <p>MedStory provided a space to work within a cross-functional team and contribute to a tool with direct impact on patient well-being. I learned how to bridge frontend design with backend data handling and communicate across stages of development. The experience sharpened my full-stack fluency and gave me insight into what it means to build meaningful products in healthcare.</p>
